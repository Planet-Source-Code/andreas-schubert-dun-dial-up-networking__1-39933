### API Declarations

```
Ever tried to integrate dial-up networking into your project?
I'm speaking of creating, altering or deleting entries as well as altering properties,
enumerating connections or dialing syncronous or asyncronous.
Projection results can be retrieved also!
Well, it is not so easy and good samples are hard to find.
So I sat down and did the job of translating all the data structures
from C++ to VB.
For easy use I combined all into a little module for you.
If you find this useful, please vote. It took me quite some time to finish this.
